âœ¨ This repo contains my projects for FWD - Back End & Mobile Testing. 

## Projects
### Project 1: [API Automation Testing](/APIAutomationTesting)
This project requires to test Trello's REST APIs using Postman.

Trello is a team management web application where teams can collaborate, manage projects, and reach new productivity peaks.

I will test board creating, deleting, creating lists within a board, getting lists in a board, archiving, and un-archiving lists.

I am required to automate all the test cases and generate a testing report w/ the status of features using each test case/scenario status (PASS/FAIL), the execution time of the automated test, and the testing steps status (PASS/FAIL)
